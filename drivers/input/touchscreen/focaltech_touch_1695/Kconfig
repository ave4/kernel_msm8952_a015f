         Say Y here if you have a ft5446 touchscreen.
         Ft5446 controllers are multi touch controllers which can
         report 10 touches at a time.

         If unsure, say N.

         To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
         module will be called ft5446_ts.

    string "Focaltech ts directory name"
    default "focaltech_touch"
